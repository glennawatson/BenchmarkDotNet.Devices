## BenchmarkDotNet Devices

The framework extends [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) and allows for Xamarin targets along with targets the use [MsBuild.Sdk.Extras](https://github.com/onovotny/MSBuildSdkExtras).

The eventual goal of this repository is to go into the main BenchmarkDotNet once it has matured enough.
